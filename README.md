# GALAXY-EXPLORER-V1
This is my first project, inspired by the world's largest space exploration engine, SPACE ENGINE, but now it comes to mobile devices, you don't have to download anything, just try it and that's it.This is the first version of Galaxy Explorer, there are some bugs so I need some time to fix them, this project is made 100% with Deepseek AI
**MANDATORY READING**
There is a bug in the game controls, if you want to move forward you have to drag the joystick down, if you want to move backward, drag the joystick up, if you want to move To move right, drag the joystick to the left, and if you want to move left, drag the joystick to the right.
(This also applies to the camera movement buttons.)
IF YOU WANT TO TRANSLATE THE GAME, AT THE TOP IN THE CENTER THERE ARE BUTTONS TO TRANSLATE IT INTO ENGLISH OR SPANISH
**BUTTONS**
In the game you will see 3 buttons, one is to change the player speed, another is to change the speed of the orbits, and the third is to pause the game
**ERRORS AND THINGS YOU CAN EXPERIENCE**
If you have a low-end device, you may experience fps drops of 9 to 10 FPS, also a bug in the game is that the stars and planets will orbit when the player moves, if the player does not move, the stars and planets will remain still

The same thing happens with the camera movement buttons, if you stay still, they will stop working, unless you move again.


**THIS SIMULATOR IS A BETA, IT IS MADE 100% WITH DEEPSEEK'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND YOU MAY EXPERIENCE ANOTHER BUG OR FPS DROP**
